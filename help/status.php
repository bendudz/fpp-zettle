<p>Once you have both <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong> you will be able to see your Subscription details and all the Transactions that have come in.</p>
<p>Transactions will show newest first. Transactions details are stored on Zettle but we show the time/account and payers name that are stored localy and can be cleared. So you have the option to clear all local transactions each night or leave them for the complete secion. It is up to you.</p>
